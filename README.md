# 💧 Prediction of Drinking Water Suitability

## 📝 Description
This web application is built using **Streamlit** to predict whether water is drinkable or not, based on nine water quality parameters. The model used is the **Random Forest Classifier** which has been trained previously.

## 🧪 Parameters Used
- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity

## 🔍 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Model file: rf_model_before_normalization.pkl
- Dataset used: Water_Potability.csv (or the one in the notebook)

## 📷 Application Display
- The application displays:
- Sidebar for entering water quality parameters
- Prediction results: water is suitable or not suitable for drinking
